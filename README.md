# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of major data structures 
and algorithms in C-Sharp (C#). 
It also contains solutions and to code problems where these data structures can be applied 

### Data Structures
These data structures are the difference ways of storing data in memory and also how to access them. 
There are used to solve different problems 
- Arrays 
- LinkedList 
- Stack 
- Queues 
- HashTable | Dictionary

### Problems And Solution 
This Section contains difference code problems and solutions 
- Patterns 
- Dynamic Programing 
- Algorithms 
- Challenges (Random code challenges)
