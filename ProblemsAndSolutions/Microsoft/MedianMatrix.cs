    ///MICROSOFT QUESTIONS
    ///Given an array of integers(+ve,-ve and 0) find the sign of the product of all the given values.
    ///
    ///Given an integer(+ve or -ve) consisting of at least one 5 in its digits(can have more than one 5). Return the maximum value by deleting exactly one 5 from its digit.
    ///
    /// 
    ///Given an array N, return true if it is possible we can pair all the numbers in the array with equal values. 
    ///E.g N = [1, 2, 2, 1] -> true as we can pair (N[0], N[3]) and (N[1], N[2]). N = [7, 7, 7] would return false.
    ///
    /// 
    ///Given a string s, find the minimum number of substrings you can create without having the same letters repeating in each substring.
    //E.g world -> 5, as the string has no letters that occur more than once.
    //dddd -> 4, as you can only create substring of each character.
    //abba -> 2, as you can make substrings of ab, ba.
    //cycle-> 2, you can create substrings of (cy, cle) or (c, ycle)

    ///Maximum possible value by inserting '5'
    //    examples:
    //input: 1234 -> output: 51234
    //input: 7643 -> output 76543
    //input: 0 -> output 50
    //input: -661 -> output -5661
